# Practica 1
## Python

Para llegar a esta instancia tienen una cuenta de git hecha con sus mails.
Hicieron fork del repositorio.

Tendremos tres tipos de folders:
    Workout: ejercicios de python con sus respectivos test
    Recap: Notebook con resumen de la clase
    Cases: Casos de trabajo lo más cercano a la realidad.

Para armar sus entornos de trabajo vamos a utilizar visual studio code o pycharm.

Las configuraciones de python cambian según windows, mac o linux.

Se pueden descargar python a través de los siguientes enlaces:
    Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
    Mac:      https://www.python.org/downloads/mac/
    Linux:    https://www.python.org/downloads/linux/

Si ya tiene la consola instalada pueden descargar python en la consola con:
```
apt-get install python3.
``` 

Pueden utilizar los entornos de anaconda o crearse su entorno personalizado.

Para crear un entorno de anaconda vamos a utilizar el comando:
    conda create -n <nombre_entorno> <paquete_python>

    Ejemplo:
``` bash
    conda create -n clase_ucema python=3.7
``` 

Para crearlo con virtualenv primero tienen que instalar virtualenv:
``` bash
    pip install virtualenv
``` 
Luego vamos a crear un entorno de virtualenv:
    virtualenv <nombre_entorno>

``` bash
virtualenv -p python3 env
```
Los entornos de python sirven para aislar dependencias para que no sean conflictivas con otros proyectos.
Por lo general cuando tengamos que poner en producción un modelo o una aplicación vamos a utilizar un entorno de producción.



Objetivos:
* 1 - Determinar que esten todos los entornos seteados.


* 2 - Aprender a usar el test

```bash
make pytest # Este comando ejecuta el test

```

* 3 - Pushear al repositorio de git.



```bash
git add nombre_de_tu_archivo.py
git commit --message "Resolví el primer desafío"
git push origin master
```

```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see `WSL: Ubuntu` in a green box in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window, you're good to go :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **contact a teacher**


## Windows Terminal

### Installation

:information_source: The following instructions depend on your version of Windows.

If you are running Windows 11, the Windows Terminal is already installed and you can proceed to the next section :point_down:

If you are running Windows 10, let's install Windows Terminal, a real modern terminal:

### Ubuntu as the default terminal

Let's make Ubuntu the default terminal of your Windows Terminal application.

Press `Ctrl` + `,`

It should open the terminal settings:


- Change the default profile to "Ubuntu"
- Click on "Save"
- Click on "Open JSON file"

We have circle in red the part you will change:


First, let's ask Ubuntu to start directly inside your Ubuntu Home Directory instead of the Windows one:
- Locate the `"name": "Ubuntu",`
- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"commandline": "wsl.exe ~",
```

:warning: Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

Then, let's disable warning for copy-pasting commands between Windows and Ubuntu:
- Locate the line `"defaultProfile": "{2c4de342-...}"`
- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"multiLinePasteWarning": false,
```

:warning: Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

You can save these changes by pressing `Ctrl` + `S`

:heavy_check_mark: Your **Windows Terminal** is now setup :+1:

This terminal has tabs: you can choose to open a new terminal tab by clicking on the **+** next to the current one.

**From now on, every time we will refer to the terminal or the console it will be this one.** DO NOT use any other terminal anymore.


## VS Code Extensions

### Installation

Let's install some useful extensions to VS Code.

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings
code --install-extension emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons
code --install-extension MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension KevinRose.vsc-python-indent
code --install-extension ms-python.vscode-pylance
code --install-extension ms-toolsai.jupyter
```

Here is a list of the extensions you are installing:
- [Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)
- [VSCode Great Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons)

- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)


## Command line tools

### Zsh & Git

Instead of using the default `bash` [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)), we will use `zsh`.

We will also use [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), a command line software used for version control.

Let's install them, along with other useful tools:
- Open an **Ubuntu terminal**
- Copy and paste the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl git imagemagick jq unzip vim zsh
```

These commands will ask for your password: type it in.

:warning: When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type in your password and when you're done, press `Enter`.

### GitHub CLI installation

Let's now install [GitHub official CLI](https://cli.github.com) (Command Line Interface). It's a software used to interact with your GitHub account via the command line.

In your terminal, copy-paste the following commands and type in your password if asked:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gh
```

To check that `gh` has been successfully installed on your machine, you can run:

```bash
gh --version
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see `gh version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`, you're good to go :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **contact a teacher**


## Oh-my-zsh

Let's install the `zsh` plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:

:heavy_check_mark: If it does, you can continue :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **ask for a teacher**


## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your computer from the previous commands.

First in order to **login**, copy-paste the following command in your terminal:

:warning: **DO NOT edit the `email`**

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

gh will ask you few questions:

`What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?` With the arrows, choose `SSH` and press `Enter`. SSH is a protocol to log in using SSH keys instead of the well known username/password pair.

`Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account?` Press `Enter` to ask gh to generate the SSH keys for you.

If you already have SSH keys, you will see instead `Upload your SSH public key to your GitHub account?` With the arrows, select your public key file path and press `Enter`.

`Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional)`. Type something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. Then press `Enter`.

:warning: When you type your passphrase, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your passphrase as a whole but also its length. Just type your passphrase and when you're done, press `Enter`.

You will then get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `Enter`.

Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `Enter` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.



## Installing Python (with [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))

Ubuntu comes with an outdated version of Python that we don't want to use. You might already have installed Anaconda or something else to tinker with Python and Data Science packages. All of this does not really matter as we are going to do a professional setup of Python where you'll be able to switch which version you want to use whenever you type `python` in the terminal.

First let's install `pyenv` with the following Terminal command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
exec zsh
```

Ignore the `pyenv: no such command 'virtualenv-init' for now`.

Let's install some [dependencies](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems#prerequisites) needed to build Python from `pyenv`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev \
python-dev python3-dev
```

Let's install the [latest stable version of Python](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) supported by Le Wagon's curriculum:

```bash
pyenv install 3.8.12
```

This command might take a while, this is perfectly normal. Don't hesitate to help other students seated next to you!

OK once this command is complete, we are going to tell the system to use this version of Python **by default**. This is done with:

```bash
pyenv global 3.8.12
exec zsh
```

To check if this worked, run `python --version`. If you see `3.8.12`, perfect! If not, ask a TA that will help you debug the problem thanks to `pyenv versions` and `type -a python` (`python` should be using the `.pyenv/shims` version first).


## Python Virtual Environment

Before we start installing relevant Python packages, we will isolate the setup for the Bootcamp into a **dedicated** virtual environment. We will use a `pyenv` plugin called [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

First let's install this plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
exec zsh
```

Let's create the virtual environment we are going to use during the whole bootcamp:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.12 nombredelenv
```

Let's now set the virtual environment with:

```bash
pyenv global nombredelenv
```

Great! Anytime we'll install Python package, we'll do it in that environment.


## Python packages

Now that we have a pristine `nombredelenv` virtual environment, it's time to install some packages in it.

First, let's upgrade `pip`, the tool to install Python Packages from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). In the latest terminal where the virtualenv `nombredelenv` is activated, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```



## Configuring Jupyter Notebook to open in your browser

Let's generate the configuration file for **Jupyter Notebook**...

``` bash
jupyter notebook --generate-config
```

⚠️ Please copy the path returned by the previous command.

We will now edit the generated Jupyter configuration file:

``` bash
code $HOME/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```

Locate the following line in the configuration file:

``` python
# c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = True
```

And replace it with this one:

``` python
c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False
```

Let's try to run Jupyter:

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command should have opened a Jupyter page in your browser:


To stop the Jupyter server in the terminal, press `Ctrl` + `C`, enter y, then press Enter.


## `jupyter` notebook extensions

Pimp your `jupyter` notebooks with awesome extensions:

```bash
# install nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
jupyter nbextension enable collapsible_headings/main
jupyter nbextension enable spellchecker/main
jupyter nbextension enable code_prettify/code_prettify
```


Make sure you can run Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

And open a `Python 3` notebook.

Make sure that you are running the correct python version in the notebook. Open a cell and run :
``` python
import sys; sys.version
```

Here you have it! A complete python virtual env with all the third-party packages you'll need for the whole bootcamp.



## Windows settings

### Exchange files between Windows and Ubuntu

We need an easy way to transfer files from Windows to Ubuntu and vice versa.

In order to do that, let's create shortcuts to Ubuntu directories in the Windows **File Explorer**:
- Open the Windows File Explorer (or use the shortcut `WIN` + `E`)
- In the Address Bar, enter `\\wsl$\` (or `\\wsl$\Ubuntu` if it does not work)
- You now have acces to the Ubuntu file system
- Dive into the Ubuntu file system in order to look for directories of interest
- Drag the desired folders into the Address Bar in order to create shortcuts


### Open the Windows File Explorer from the Ubuntu terminal

Another option to move files around is to open the Windows **File Explorer** from the Ubuntu terminal:
- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Go to the directory you wish to explore
- Run the `explorer.exe .` command (alternatively, use `wslview .`)
- If you get an input output error message, run `wsl --shutdown` in a Windows PowerShell and reopen an Ubuntu terminal


### Find your way in the Ubuntu File System

You might want to figure out the exact location of a Windows directory in the Ubuntu file system, or the other way around.

In order to convert a Windows path to and from an Ubuntu path:
- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Use the `wslpath "C:\Program Files"` command in order to translate a Windows path into an Ubuntu path
- Use the `wslpath -w "/home"` command in order to translate an Ubuntu path into a Windows path
- In particular, the `wslpath -w $(pwd)` command returns the Windows path of the current Ubuntu directory


## Visual C++ Redistributable

Some Python packages require a compiler to function properly. Let's install one:

[For x64 systems](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)


[For x86 systems](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
